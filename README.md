# tdd-examples
Learning to solve problems using the TDD approach. Below is a list of all the problems solved;
<br>

* Add two numbers
* Add an indefinite amount of numbers
* Takes two numbers as argument and return the difference between the numbers
* Multiply an indefinite amount of arguments
* Takes two numbers as arguments and returns the first number divided by the second number.
* Takes two strings as arguments and return the concatenation of the two strings.
* Takes a username as an argument and makes a call to GitHub API and returns all the repositories owned by the user as an array.

I will be making use of jest as my testing framework. Jest is a delightful javascript testing framwork with a focus on simplicity.    
you can install jest using npm

```

npm init

npm install --save-dev jest

// change the value of test in scripts to jest in your package.json

{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}

```
