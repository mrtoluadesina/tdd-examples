I will be making use of jest as my testing framework. Jest is a delightful javascript testing framwork with a focus on simplicity.    
you can install jest using npm

```

npm init

npm install --save-dev jest

// change the value of test in scripts to jest in your package.json

{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}

```
